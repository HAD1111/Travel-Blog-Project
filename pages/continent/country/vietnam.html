                    <h2 class="info-title">History of Vietnam</h2>
                    <p class="info">Vietnam's history spans over 4,000 years, beginning with the ancient Dong Son civilization, renowned for its advanced bronze-working. The country was under Chinese domination for over a millennium (111 BCE–939 CE), shaping its language, governance, and cultural practices. After achieving independence in 938 CE through the Battle of Bach Dang, Vietnam flourished under successive dynasties such as the Ly, Tran, and Nguyen, which left a legacy of Buddhist art, Confucian principles, and architectural wonders.<br><br>In the 19th century, Vietnam fell under French colonial rule, which introduced Western education, Christianity, and infrastructure while fueling nationalist movements. The country’s modern history was defined by the Vietnam War (1955–1975), a devastating conflict that ended with the communist North unifying the nation. Post-war recovery was challenging, but since the Doi Moi reforms in 1986, Vietnam has transformed into a fast-growing economy and a vital cultural and political hub in Southeast Asia.</p>

                    <h2 class="info-title">Culture of Vietnam</h2>
                    <p class="info">Vietnamese culture is a harmonious blend of indigenous traditions and external influences, shaped by centuries of Chinese, French, and American contact. Deeply rooted in Confucian values, family is the cornerstone of society, and respect for elders is highly emphasized. Traditional festivals, such as Tet (Lunar New Year) and Mid-Autumn Festival, are integral to community life, celebrating heritage and family unity.<br><br>Religion plays a significant role, with a mix of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and ancestral worship coexisting alongside Catholicism and growing Protestantism. Vietnamese society values hard work, education, and humility, and these principles are reflected in daily life and customs. Despite rapid modernization, traditional practices like wearing the ao dai (national dress) and traditional water puppet shows remain important symbols of cultural pride.</p>

                    <h2 class="info-title">Vietnamese Arts</h2>
                    <p class="info">Vietnamese arts are deeply tied to its spiritual and historical roots. Traditional lacquer painting and silk painting are highly regarded for their intricate detail and vibrant colors. Woodblock printing, popularized in the village of Dong Ho, captures rural life and folklore through bold, colorful designs. Architecture, from the ancient pagodas to the grandiose Imperial Citadel of Hue, showcases Vietnam’s blend of indigenous and external styles.<br><br>Modern art in Vietnam is thriving, with a focus on abstract and contemporary works that explore themes of identity and modernization. Galleries in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City highlight a vibrant art scene, bridging traditional techniques with modern aesthetics.</p>

                    <h2 class="info-title">Vietnamese Literature</h2>
                    <p class="info">Vietnamese literature has deep roots, beginning with oral traditions and ancient poetry. Early works, such as “Tale of Kieu” by Nguyen Du, remain cultural treasures, blending Confucian ideals with vivid storytelling. Classical literature was heavily influenced by Chinese, written in chữ Nôm (a Vietnamese script derived from Chinese characters) until the Latin alphabet became dominant during French rule.</p>

                    <h2 class="info-title">Vietnamese Music</h2>
                    <p class="info">Vietnam’s music reflects its history, blending indigenous and foreign elements. Traditional genres like ca tru (a form of chamber music) and quan ho (folk singing) emphasize poetic lyrics and complex rhythms. Instruments such as the dan bau (monochord zither) and dan tranh (16-string zither) are central to traditional performances. Water puppetry, accompanied by live traditional music, remains a beloved cultural art form.</p>

                    <h2 class="info-title">Vietnamese Media And Cinema</h2>
                    <p class="info">Vietnamese cinema has grown from a tool for wartime propaganda to a globally recognized art form. Early films, often documentaries, were used to inspire nationalism during the French colonial era and the Vietnam War. Post-war cinema, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, reflected the struggles of rebuilding a nation, with films like “The Scent of Green Papaya” (1993) gaining international acclaim.<br><br>In recent years, Vietnam’s film industry has embraced a broader range of genres, including romance, comedy, and action. Modern filmmakers like Tran Anh Hung and Nguyen Quang Dung have brought global attention to Vietnamese cinema, while local blockbusters like “Furie” (2019) showcase the industry’s growing appeal.</p>

                    <h2 class="info-title">Vietnamese cuisine</h2>
                    <p class="info">Vietnamese cuisine is renowned worldwide for its balance of flavors—sweet, sour, salty, and spicy—and its emphasis on fresh ingredients. Staples include pho (noodle soup), banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich), and bun cha (grilled pork with noodles). Dishes are often served with fresh herbs, lime, and dipping sauces like nuoc cham to enhance flavors.<br><br>Regional diversity plays a significant role in the cuisine. Northern dishes, like pho, are subtle and delicate, while central cuisine, such as bun bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup), is bold and spicy. Southern cuisine is sweeter and heavily influenced by tropical ingredients like coconut. Street food culture is vibrant, offering dishes like banh xeo (crispy pancakes) and fresh spring rolls, providing an authentic taste of Vietnam’s culinary heritage.</p>
