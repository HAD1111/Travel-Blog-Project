                    <p class="info">Jordan is a young state that occupies an ancient land, one that bears the traces of
                        many civilizations. Separated from ancient Palestine by the Jordan River, the region played a
                        prominent role in biblical history. The ancient biblical kingdoms of Moab, Gilead, and Edom lie
                        within its borders as does the famed red stone city of Petra, the capital of the Nabatean
                        kingdom and of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. British traveler Gertrude Bell said of
                        Petra, “It is like a fairy tale city, all pink and wonderful.” Part of the Ottoman Empire until
                        1918 and later a mandate of the United Kingdom, Jordan has been an independent kingdom since
                        1946. It is among the most politically liberal countries of the Arab world, and, although it
                        shares in the troubles affecting the region, its rulers have expressed a commitment to
                        maintaining peace and stability.<br><br>The capital and largest city in the country is
                        Amman—named for the Ammonites, who made the city their capital in the 13th century bce. Amman
                        was later a great city of Middle Eastern antiquity, Philadelphia, of the Roman Decapolis, and
                        now serves as one of the region’s principal commercial and transportation centers as well as one
                        of the Arab world’s major cultural capitals.</p>

                    <p class="info">The culture of Jordan is based on Arabic and Islamic elements. Jordan stands at the
                        intersection of the three continents of the ancient world, lending it geographic and population
                        diversity. Notable aspects of the culture include the traditional music and clothing of Jordan
                        and interest in sports. These include football and basketball as well as other sports such as
                        equestrianism, fencing, karate, swimming, and table tennis.</p>

                    <p class="info">One of the key aspects of Jordanian culture is the hospitality shown by hosts to
                        their guests. This is felt even while walking around the streets of Jordan, where the phrase
                        "ahlan wa sahlan" ("I welcome you") is heard nearly everywhere you go.</p>

                    <p class="info">The modern literary movement in Jordan began in the 20th century during the Al-Nahda
                        cultural renaissance with works of Khalil Beidas, considered the pioneer of the modern Levantine
                        short-story and novel, and Mohammad Subhi Abu Ghanimeh. In the 1930s, Palestinian writer Mahmoud
                        Seif ed-Din al-Irani published his short stories while working for the Jordanian Ministry of
                        Culture,[10] characterized by a "once-upon-a-time resonance and a pronounced folklorishness.</p>

                    <h2 class="info-title">Jordanian Mansaf</h2>
                    <p class="info">The national dish in Jordan is mansaf, a dish that is associated with Bedouin
                        traditions. Despite these rural roots, it is shared by Jordanians of many diverse backgrounds,
                        not just Bedouins or those who can trace their ancestral lines back to Bedouins. The dish is
                        composed of a bread called sherack, lamb meat, and yogurt (jameed). Recently, rice and nuts have
                        been added to the dish, and some regions in Jordan add seasoning. It is served on a large,
                        circular platter. The ingredients are combined to form several layers. The first layer is made
                        of thin, unleavened bread, shredded and soaked in yogurt broth. Next is a layer of rice which
                        covers the bread. Large chunks of lamb that have been simmered in the same type of yogurt broth
                        are placed on top of the rice. The head of the lamb is placed in the center of the tray. Pine
                        nuts, almonds, and parsley are sprinkled atop the meat and rice. The final step involves pouring
                        a yogurt broth over the entire dish, which is then added periodically throughout the meal to
                        keep the dish warm and moist. Traditionally, mansaf is eaten while sitting on the floor, using
                        ones hands to eat from a large, circular communal tray. This tradition still persists, although
                        in modern years, many people have taken to eating the dish with silverware. Most admit, however,
                        that mansaf tastes better when eaten with the hand. The dish takes hours to prepare and thus is
                        primarily served only on special occasions.</p>
