                        <h2 class="info-title">Italy History</h2>
                        <p class="info">Italy’s history spans thousands of years, from its ancient civilizations to its modern influence. As the heart of the Roman Empire (509 BCE–476 CE), Italy shaped the foundations of Western civilization through its innovations in law, governance, architecture, and culture. After the empire’s fall, the region became a mosaic of city-states and kingdoms. The Renaissance (14th–17th centuries) began in Italy, with cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome becoming centers of art, science, and philosophy. The 19th century saw the unification of Italy under the leadership of figures like Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II. After turbulent years under Fascism and World War II, Italy became a republic in 1946 and is now a global hub of culture, art, and innovation.</p>

                        <p class="info">Italian culture is deeply rooted in tradition, community, and passion for life. Family is the cornerstone of Italian society, and its influence is evident in everything from food to celebrations. Religion, particularly Roman Catholicism, has also played a significant role in shaping Italy’s customs and identity. Italy’s vibrant festivals, such as Venice’s Carnival and Siena’s Palio, reflect its rich cultural heritage. Italians are also celebrated for their sense of style, with the country often referred to as the global capital of fashion.</p>

                        <p class="info">Italy is a global treasure trove of art, with its legacy spanning from antiquity to modern times. It is home to masterpieces such as Michelangelo’s David and the Sistine Chapel ceiling, Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, and Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus. The country’s contributions to architecture include Roman marvels like the Colosseum and Renaissance landmarks such as St. Peter’s Basilica. Italy continues to inspire artists worldwide through its museums, galleries, and historic sites.</p>

                        <h2 class="info-title">Italy Literature</h2>
                        <p class="info">Italian literature has profoundly shaped Western thought. Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy is considered a cornerstone of world literature, while Petrarch and Boccaccio were instrumental in the development of humanism during the Renaissance. Later authors, such as Niccolò Machiavelli, explored politics and philosophy in works like The Prince. Modern Italian writers, such as Italo Calvino and Elena Ferrante, have continued this legacy with globally acclaimed novels.</p>

                        <h2 class="info-title">Italy Music</h2>
                        <p class="info">Italy is the birthplace of opera, with composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, and Claudio Monteverdi revolutionizing the art form. Italy also made significant contributions to classical music, with Antonio Vivaldi and Ludovico Einaudi enchanting audiences worldwide. Traditional Italian folk music, with its regional variations, remains an integral part of cultural celebrations. Instruments like the violin and piano, developed in Italy, are vital to global music traditions.</p>

                        <p class="info">Italian cinema has had a profound impact on the global film industry. The neorealism movement, led by directors like Roberto Rossellini (Rome, Open City) and Vittorio De Sica (Bicycle Thieves), depicted the struggles of post-war life with raw emotion. Later filmmakers, including Federico Fellini (La Dolce Vita) and Sergio Leone (spaghetti westerns), pushed artistic and narrative boundaries. Modern directors like Paolo Sorrentino continue to bring Italian cinema to international acclaim.</p>

                        <h2 class="info-title">Italy cuisine</h2>
                        <p class="info">Italy cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus. The Italy national dishes are the kibbe, a meat pie made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul wheat. Italy restaurant meals begin with a wide array of mezze – small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled meat or fish. In general, meals are finished with Arabic coffee and fresh fruit, though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.</p>
